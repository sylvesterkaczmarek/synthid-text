  Method uses adapted linear congruential generator (LCG)

  This function has following property -
  f(x, data[T]) = f(f(x, data[:T - 1]), data[T])

  This function expects current_hash.shape and data.shape[:-1] to
  match/broadcastable.

  Args:
    current_hash: (shape,)
    data: (shape, tensor_len)
    multiplier: (int) multiplier of linear congruential generator
    increment: (int) increment of linear congruential generator

  Returns:
